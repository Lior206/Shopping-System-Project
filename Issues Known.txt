Issues Known –
1. Code duplication (Buyer, Seller).
2. We did not block the option that a buyer would buy the same product twice from a seller and on the same order
4. Code efficiency in function that related to copy objects (Order, Product, Seller, Buyer, Feedback).
5. Using checking function more than one time with Validate class for same input.
6. We didn't use iterators
